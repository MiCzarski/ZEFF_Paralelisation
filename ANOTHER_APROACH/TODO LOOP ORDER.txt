It's not guaranteed that parallelizing a code will always result in faster execution. 
The effectiveness of parallelization depends on various factors, including the nature of the computation, the size of the problem, and the underlying hardware.

In your specific case, the parallelized version of the subroutine (XYCALCZEFF_PARALLEL) introduces parallelism through OpenMP directives. 
However, the overhead of managing parallel threads, especially for relatively small computational workloads, might outweigh the benefits of parallelization. 
Additionally, the loop structure and the nature of the computations within the loop may not be highly parallelizable.

The performance gain from parallelization is often more noticeable when dealing with larger data sets or more computationally intensive tasks. 
For smaller problems, the overhead of parallelization can sometimes lead to a slowdown.

If you're finding that the linear version (XYCALCZEFF_LINEAR) is faster than the parallel version,
 it might be worth considering other optimizations or profiling tools to understand where the bottlenecks are and if there are other ways to improve performance.

You can use profiling tools to analyze the performance of your code and identify hotspots or areas that could benefit from optimization. 
Additionally, experimenting with different compiler optimization flags or restructuring your code may lead to performance improvements.

Remember that the performance of parallelized code can also depend on the specific characteristics of the hardware you are running the code on.
